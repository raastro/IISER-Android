# IISER App for Android
Welcome to the IISER App.
This App is an attempt to make life at IISER a tad bit more manageable. It contains the links to useful IISER resources. As these resources involve signing in, it becomes a necessity for me to say that we do not collect or store any data on any server (we don't have any). All password data is stored only on your phone. The app is merely a one-click link to where you want to go.

Special Course - Some courses require more frequent visits than others; hence, we have also provided a shortcut to a specific course. Head to the Settings page to change the ID.

### Webmail

### Feedback

### WiFi password
This allows you to send a pre-drafted email requesting for a password for the Student's WiFi.

### Books Drive Link
A Drive link to almost all the necessary material for the First and Second Year. Please keep in mind that this is NOT an official repository and may be discontinued in the future.

### Webmail Settings
Due to the old setup of the Webmail that IISERM uses, your Email account DOESN'T automatically get added to your Gmail App. So, it takes a little more effort to add it. The following steps help you to do just that.

### UPI Payments
You can use the app to make UPI payment to Canteens, Eateries, Messes and Shops in campus. You need Google Pay, ICICI, SBI or equivalent app to use this feature.

### Settings
Change Settings like Moodle Username and Password.
